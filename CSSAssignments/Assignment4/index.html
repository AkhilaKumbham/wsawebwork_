                <p>Three sentences max.<br>
                Persuade reader you have novel, interesting question(s) and hypothesis. Resist urge to use all the white space.</p>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>Highlight your LARGE photographs, charts, maps, or in this central arena. Don’t include every graphic you’ve made that relates to project. Choose one. Or two. And separate graphics with plenty of white space.</p>

            <div class="yellow-box">
                <p style="color: #cc0000;">If you have just one or two simple graphics, viewers will be drawn to explore them. If you have too many or they are too complicated, visitors will be repelled.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Annotate graphics with arrows and callout boxes so that viewer is visually led through how hypothesis is addressed. The goal is to enable viewers to understand the logic behind your conclusions without you needing to be there.</p>
            <p>Keep font size of all text (even graph labels) as big or bigger than in rest of poster.</p>
